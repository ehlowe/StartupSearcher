# Startup Search Tool

This project takes crunchbase data and allows the user to rate companies on a scale of 0-5 with any given input criteria. It also has a pie chart on the left side shows the distribution of employee count, industry, or funding status for the 5* rating companies.

It uses a PostgreSQL database, PyQt gui, and gpt-4o-mini for ratings.
